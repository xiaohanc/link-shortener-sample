# link-shortener-sample
A sample web app to shorten url and redirect to original url based on python3 flask.
The html used bootstrap component jumbotron for message call. Sqlites3 are used for database to insert and query urls. I am converting the url database id to short string of redirect url with base10 and base62 convert functions. 

## Core functions
The core converting functions stored in [`core/id_convert.py`](https://github.com/xiaohanc/link-shortener-sample/blob/master/core/id_convert.py) The core concept in this app is focus on converting database id to base62('a-z' 32 + 'A-Z' 32 + '0-9' 10 =62) for large system with a bunch of datas. After `id_to_base62(num)` converting completed, we will receive a short string to add host base domain in order to fomulate a shorter url. When user click converted url, app will cut the head host domain and pass the rest short string to `url_to_base10(short_url)`, translate to base10 database id, then sql query stored original url and redirect.


## Run app
pip install flask, run 
```
python3 main.py
```

## Usage of app
The app 
1. The first time running this app, it will check the urls.lb to see if there is a table WEB_url created, if not create one.
2. User open the homepage http://localhost:5000 (if run it on local) and submit the target url. It will route POST requests to flask app with target url. Firstly it will check the url format, add 'https://' if the url does not contain http or https, then executed sql command `INSERT INTO WEB_URL (URL) VALUES (?)` with encoded url and return id as a encoded string with host url to User.
3. When user type host url with short encoded id string, the flask app will decode the id string, executed sql query `SELECT URL FROM WEB_URL WHERE ID=?` with decoded id, get the saved url from database and redirect to target url.
